%I am interested in an iOS development internship at Procore because I was recommended by Daniel Phillips at the UCI Winter career fair. I seek to make nontrivial applications with my iOS skills and I believe that at Procore with its open, collaborative culture, I will be able to further develop my skills.\\[3mm]
%I am particularly very fascinated by the field of product management and its integration with backgrounds concerning user experience, business, and technology. I have been working with iOS for around a month now, and I am currently involved in two side projects that are helping me increase my proficiency. By the end of these projects, I will have attained a good amount of practical experience. What I am really needing, however, is a chance to work with more experienced mentors in an agile or lean environment. Through projects such as my Eagle Project and HackUCI, I understand the importance of establishing team cooperation by having a shared passion and a mutual vision of accomplishing set goals. By working with product managers and design engineers, I will be able to have a sense of the key heuristics that it takes to create a successful product.
%\\[3mm]
%I feel that with my strong motivation and passion in iOS and product management, I will be a great fit with the environment at Procore. I would like the opportunity to have an interview in order to discuss my experiences in more detail. I am best reached through email, and I will follow up with you in two weeks to check the status of my application. Thank you for your consideration.
%%first paragraph talk about what stands out, in the second detail the projects and move what i want to the third paragraph
