%I am interested in an internship at Buzzfeed because with its open, collaborative culture, I will be able to really refine my skills.\\[3mm]
%I learned a great deal of both hard and soft skills through working at Rohm and developing my personal projects. Because of these experiences I was able to rapidly learn software engineering skills to use in nontrivial applications. I extensively used git throughout these projects as well. My degree specialization allows me to understand the software development process from multiple points of view. I realize the importance of establishing team cooperation by having a shared passion and a mutual vision of accomplishing set goals.
%\\[3mm]
%I am very fascinated by software and its integration with backgrounds concerning user experience, business, and technology. What I am really needing, however, is a chance to work with more experienced mentors in an agile or lean environment. By working with product managers and design engineers, I will be able to have a sense of the key heuristics that it takes to create a successful product. I would like the opportunity to have an interview in order to discuss my experiences in more detail. I am best reached through email, and I will follow up with you in two weeks to check the status of my application. Thank you for your consideration.\\[3mm]
